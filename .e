ncflint: WARNING Input variables have different NCO_MSS_VAL_SNG's:
Variable #1 = t_mean has NCO_MSS_VAL_SNG type = NC_DOUBLE, value = 1.00000002004e+20
Variable #2 = t_mean has NCO_MSS_VAL_SNG type = NC_DOUBLE, value = -0
Variable #3 = output = t_mean will have NCO_MSS_VAL_SNG type = NC_DOUBLE, value = 1.00000002004e+20
Will translate values of var2 equaling mss_val2 to mss_val1 before evaluating arithmetic operation to compute var3
